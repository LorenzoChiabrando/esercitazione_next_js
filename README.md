## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

## Authentication enhancements

This project now ships with a complete authentication flow that supports:

- Traditional email and password login backed by the project database.
- Google single sign-on through NextAuth.
- A dedicated registration page that lets new users create an account and access the dashboard immediately.

To enable Google authentication, make sure to provide the following environment variables:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
```
